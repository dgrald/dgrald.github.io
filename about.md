I'm a 29 year old software engineer with 6+ years of professional software development experience. I work as a software consultant and am a co-founder at <a href="https://info.dtxintelligence.com">DTx Intelligence</a>. I'm interested in learning new skills and transitioning more into research software development.

In particular, I've been interested in high performance computing and test-driven development. For back-end development, I predominately employ Scala/Play and Python/AWS Lambdas/Serverless, but I have professional software experience in many other languages and frameworks: C#, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, Django, etc.

In the winter, I spend my weekends telemark skiing. In the summer, I mountain bike and climb. I have a fondness for the granite slabs in Squamish, BC.
